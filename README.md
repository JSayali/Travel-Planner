### Description
`Travel Planner` is a web application which provides a platform to allow group of people going on a trip to interact with each other and plan the trip activities. It is in the initial stages of development and can be said as a good example of [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) for the travel planning web sites. 

### Features 
* A `blog` area to discuss and share trip ideas
* A basic `To-Do List` to keep a track of all the things and activities that are important. 

To access the application, user needs to register and create credentials. After successful registration, user can login to the application and use all the features it provides. Currently, the application has only one group called 'Paris trip' and all the registered users will be automatically added to that group.
